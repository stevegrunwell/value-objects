# The Beauty of PHP Value Objects

Imagine, if you will, a world where you're able to define a tailor-made type for domain objects that is always valid, type-safe, immutable, and easy to test. No more email addresses passed around as plain strings, nor associative arrays being passed around with potentially-undefined keys and unpredictable types.

In this session, we'll dive deep into PHP Value Objects: where are they useful, how do we write (and test!) them, and how do we ensure that the data they encapsulate is valid? Attendees will leave with a better understanding of domain modeling, Value Objects, and immutability.

Warning: once you start using proper value objects, you may never be able to go back to using anything else!
